But beneath the surface chatter there’s not always a deep, clear understanding of what blockchain is, how it works, or what it’s for. Despite its reputation for impenetrability, the basic idea behind blockchain is pretty simple. And it has major potential to change industries from the bottom up.\\n\\nGet to know and directly engage with McKinsey’s senior experts on blockchain\\n\\nBrant Carson is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Vancouver office, and Marie-Claude Nadeau is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui is a McKinsey Global Institute partner.\\n\\nPut simply, blockchain is a technology that enables the secure sharing of information. Data, obviously, is stored in a database. Transactions are recorded in an account book called a ledger. A blockchain is a type of distributed database or ledger, which means the power to update a blockchain is distributed between the nodes, or participants, of a public or private computer network. This is known as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Nodes are rewarded with digital tokens or currency to make updates to blockchains.\\n\\nBlockchain allows for the permanent, immutable, and transparent recording of data and transactions. This, in turn, makes it possible to exchange anything that has value, whether that’s a physical item or something more intangible.\\n\\nA blockchain has three central attributes:\\n\\nFirst, a blockchain database must be cryptographically secure. That means you need two cryptographic keys to access or add data on the database: a public key, which is basically the address in the database, and the private key, which is an individualized key that must be authenticated by the network.\\n\\nNext, a blockchain is a digital log or database of transactions, meaning it happens fully online.\\n\\nAnd finally, a blockchain is a database that is shared across a public or private network. One of the most well-known public blockchain networks is the Bitcoin blockchain. Anyone can open a Bitcoin wallet or become a node on the network. Other blockchains are private networks. These are more applicable to banking and fintech, where people need to know exactly who is participating, who has access to data, and who has a private key to the database. Other types of blockchains include consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains, both of which combine different aspects of public and private blockchains.\\n\\nFor all its potential, blockchain has yet to become the game changer some expected. So how can we know what’s real and what’s just hype? And can companies still use blockchain to build efficiency, increase security, and create value? Read on to find out.\\n\\nLearn more about McKinsey’s Financial Services Practice.\\n\\nHow does blockchain work?\\n\\nA deeper dive may help in understanding how blockchain and other DLTs work.\\n\\nWhen data on a blockchain is accessed or altered, the record is stored in a “block” alongside the records of other transactions. Stored transactions are encrypted via unique, unchangeable hashes. New data blocks don’t overwrite old ones; they are “chained” together so any changes can be monitored.\\n\\nThese blocks of encrypted data are permanently “chained” to one another, and transactions are recorded sequentially and indefinitely, creating a perfect audit history that allows visibility into past versions of the blockchain.\\n\\nWhen new data is added to the network, the majority of nodes must verify and confirm the legitimacy of the new data based on permissions or economic incentives, also known as consensus mechanisms. When a consensus is reached, a new block is created and attached to the chain. All nodes are then updated to reflect the blockchain ledger.\\n\\nIntroducing McKinsey Explainers: Direct answers to complex questions\\n\\nIn a public blockchain network, the first node to credibly prove the legitimacy of a transaction receives an economic incentive. This process is called “mining.”\\n\\nHere’s a theoretical example to help illustrate how blockchain works. Imagine that someone is looking to buy a concert ticket on the resale market. This person has been scammed before by someone selling a fake ticket, so she decides to try one of the blockchain-enabled decentralized ticket exchange websites that have been created in the past few years. On these sites, every ticket is assigned a unique, immutable, and verifiable identity that is tied to a real person. Before the concertgoer purchases her ticket, the majority of the nodes on the network validate the seller’s credentials, ensuring that the ticket is in fact real. She buys her ticket and enjoys the concert.\\n\\nWhat is proof of work and how is it different from proof of stake?\\n\\nRemember the idea of consensus mechanisms? There are two ways blockchain nodes arrive at a consensus: through private blockchains, where trusted corporations are the gatekeepers of changes or additions to the blockchain, or through public, mass-market blockchains.\\n\\nMost public blockchains arrive at consensus by either a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake system. In a proof-of-work system, the first node, or participant, to verify a new data addition or transaction on the digital ledger receives a certain number of tokens as a reward. To complete the verification process, the participant, or “miner,” must solve a cryptographic question. The first miner who solves the puzzle is awarded the tokens.\\n\\nOriginally, people on various blockchains mined as a hobby. But because this process is potentially lucrative, blockchain mining has been industrialized. These proof-of-work blockchain-mining pools have attracted attention for the amount of energy they consume.\\n\\nIn September 2022, Ethereum, an open-source cryptocurrency network, addressed concerns about energy usage by upgrading its software architecture to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Known simply as “the Merge,” this event is seen by cryptophiles as a banner moment in the history of blockchain. With proof of stake, investors deposit their crypto coins in a shared pool in exchange for the chance to earn tokens as a reward. In proof-of-stake systems, miners are scored based on the number of native protocol coins they have in their digital wallets and the length of time they have had them. The miner with the most coins at stake has a greater chance to be chosen to validate a transaction and receive a reward.\\n\\nLearn more about proof of stake.\\n\\nHow can businesses benefit from blockchain?\\n\\nBlockchain and DLTs could create new opportunities for businesses by decreasing risk and reducing compliance costs, creating more cost-efficient transactions, driving automated and secure contract fulfillment, and increasing network transparency. Let’s break it down further:\\n\\nReduced risk and lower compliance costs. Banks rely on “know your customer” (KYC) processes to bring customers on board and retain them. But many existing KYC processes are outdated and drive costs of as much as $500 million per year, per bank. A new DLT system might require only one KYC verification per customer, driving efficiency gains, cost reduction, and improved transparency and customer experience.\\n\\nCost-efficient transactions. Digitizing records and issuing them on a universal ledger can help save significant time and costs, which can matter more in some trades than in others. In a letter of credit deal, for example, two companies opted for a paperless solution and used blockchain to trade nearly $100,000 worth of butter and cheese—clearly a time-sensitive transaction. By doing so, a process that previously took up to ten days was reduced to less than four hours—from issuing to approving the letter of credit.\\n\\nAutomated and secure contract fulfillment. Smart contracts are sets of instructions coded into tokens issued on a blockchain that can self-execute under specific conditions. These can enable automated fulfillment of contracts. For example, one retailer wanted to streamline its supply-chain-management efforts, so it began recording all processes and actions, from vendor to customer, and coding them into smart contracts on a blockchain. This effort not only made it easier to trace the provenance of food for safer consumption but also required less human effort and improved the ability to track lost products.\\n\\nLearn more about McKinsey’s Financial Services Practice.\\n\\nHow are blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance connected?\\n\\nBlockchain enables buyers and sellers to trade cryptocurrencies online without the need for banks or other intermediaries.\\n\\nAll digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, are based on blockchain technology. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a group of applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain designed to replace current financial intermediaries with smart contract-based services. Like blockchain, DeFi applications are decentralized, meaning that anyone who has access to an application has control over any changes or additions made to it. This means that users potentially have more direct control over their money.\\n\\nWhat else can blockchain be used for?\\n\\nCryptocurrency is only the tip of the iceberg. Use cases for blockchain are expanding rapidly beyond person-to-person exchanges, especially as blockchain is paired with other emerging technologies. Examples of other blockchain use cases include the following:\\n\\nWith blockchain, companies can create an indelible audit trail through a sequential and indefinite recording of transactions. This allows for systems that keep static records (of land titles, for example) or dynamic records (such as the exchange of assets).\\n\\nBlockchain allows companies to track a transaction down to its current status. This enables companies to determine exactly where the data originated and where it was delivered, which helps to prevent data breaches.\\n\\nBlockchain supports smart contracts.\\n\\nWhat are some concerns around the future of blockchain?\\n\\nWhile blockchain may be a potential game changer, there are doubts emerging about its true business value. One major concern is that for all the idea-stage use cases, hyperbolic headlines, and billions of dollars of investments, there remain very few practical, scalable use cases of blockchain.\\n\\nOne reason for this is the emergence of competing technologies. In the payments space, for example, blockchain isn’t the only fintech disrupting the value chain—60 percent of the nearly $12 billion invested in US fintechs in 2021 was focused on payments and lending. Given how complicated blockchain solutions can be—and the fact that simple solutions are frequently the best—blockchain may not always be the answer to payment challenges.\\n\\nLooking ahead, some believe the value of blockchain lies in applications that democratize data, enable collaboration, and solve specific pain points. McKinsey research shows that these specific use cases are where blockchain holds the most potential, rather than those in financial services.\\n\\nLearn more about McKinsey’s Financial Services Practice.\\n\\nHow might blockchain evolve over time?\\n\\nMcKinsey estimates that there will be two primary development horizons for blockchain over the next decade:\\n\\nGrowth of blockchain as a service (BaaS). BaaS is a cloud-based service that builds digital products for DLT and blockchain environments without any setup requirements for infrastructure. This is currently being led by Big Tech companies.\\n\\nInteroperability across blockchain networks and outside systems. Increased interoperability will mean that disparate blockchain networks and external systems will be able to view, access, and share one another’s data while maintaining integrity. Hardware standardization and scalable consensus algorithms will enable cross-network use cases—such as the Internet of Things on blockchain infrastructure.\\n\\nThese trends will be enabled partly because of increased pressure from regulators and consumers demanding greater supply chain transparency, and partly because of economic uncertainty, as consumers seek out independent, centrally regulated systems. And large corporations launching successful pilots will build confidence for consumers and other organizations.\\n\\nPotential growth could be inhibited by a few factors: for one, several well-known applications have inherently limited scalability, including energy or infrastructure requirements. Further, uncertainty about regulatory or governance developments could keep consumers shy—for instance, if there is a lack of clarity on who will enforce smart contracts. The unresolved threat of cyberattacks also remains a fear for potential blockchain users. And finally, other tech trends—namely AI—have sucked up all the oxygen (and funding) in the room.\\n\\nWhat do NFTs have to do with blockchain?\\n\\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) are minted on smart-contract blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana. NFTs represent unique assets that can’t be replicated—that’s the nonfungible part—and can’t be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. These assets include anything from a Picasso painting to a digital “This is fine” dog meme. Because NFTs are built on top of blockchains, their unique identities and ownership can be verified through the ledger. With some NFTs, the owner receives a royalty every time the NFT is traded.\\n\\nThe NFT market is extremely volatile: in 2021, one NFT created by the digital artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, was sold at Christie’s for $69.3 million. But NFT sales have shrunk dramatically since summer 2022. As of 2023, according to a report from crypto analysis firm dappGambl, 95 percent of NFTs are worth practically nothing.\\n\\nLearn more about McKinsey’s Financial Services Practice.\\n\\nHow secure is blockchain?\\n\\nBlockchain has been called a “truth machine.” While it does eliminate many of the issues that arose in Web 2.0, such as piracy and scamming, it’s not the be-all and end-all for digital security. The technology itself is essentially foolproof, but, ultimately, it is only as noble as the people using it and as reliable as the data they are adding to it.\\n\\nA motivated group of hackers could leverage blockchain’s algorithm to their advantage by taking control of more than half of the nodes on the network. With this simple majority, the hackers have consensus and thus the power to verify fraudulent transactions.\\n\\nIn 2022, hackers did exactly that, stealing more than $600 million from the gaming-centered blockchain platform Ronin Network. This challenge, in addition to the obstacles regarding scalability and standardization, will need to be addressed. But there is still significant potential for blockchain, both for business and society.\\n\\nFor a more in-depth exploration of these topics, see McKinsey’s “Blockchain and Digital Assets” collection.

            "Put simply, blockchain is a technology that enables the secure sharing of information. Data, obviously, is stored in a database. Transactions are recorded in an account book called a ledger. A blockchain is a type of distributed database or ledger, which means the power to update a blockchain is distributed between the nodes, or participants, of a public or private computer network. This is known as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Nodes are rewarded with digital tokens or currency to make updates to blockchains.\n",

Anyone can open a Bitcoin wallet or become a node on the network. Other blockchains are private networks. These are more applicable to banking and fintech, where people need to know exactly who is participating, who has access to data, and who has a private key to the database.

On these sites, every ticket is assigned a unique, immutable, and verifiable identity that is tied to a real person.

            "Most public blockchains arrive at consensus by either a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake system. In a proof-of-work system, the first node, or participant, to verify a new data addition or transaction on the digital ledger receives a certain number of tokens as a reward. To complete the verification process, the participant, or “miner,” must solve a cryptographic question. The first miner who solves the puzzle is awarded the tokens.\n",

Known simply as “the Merge,” this event is seen by cryptophiles as a banner moment in the history of blockchain. With proof of stake, investors deposit their crypto coins in a shared pool in exchange for the chance to earn tokens as a reward. In proof-of-stake systems, miners are scored based on the number of native protocol coins they have in their digital wallets and the length of time they have had them. The miner with the most coins at stake has a greater chance to be chosen to validate a transaction and receive a reward.\n",

            "Blockchain and DLTs could create new opportunities for businesses by decreasing risk and reducing compliance costs, creating more cost-efficient transactions, driving automated and secure contract fulfillment, and increasing network transparency. Let’s break it down further:\n",
            "\n",
            "Reduced risk and lower compliance costs. Banks rely on “know your customer” (KYC) processes to bring customers on board and retain them. But many existing KYC processes are outdated and drive costs of as much as $500 million per year, per bank. A new DLT system might require only one KYC verification per customer, driving efficiency gains, cost reduction, and improved transparency and customer experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cost-efficient transactions. Digitizing records and issuing them on a universal ledger can help save significant time and costs, which can matter more in some trades than in others. In a letter of credit deal, for example, two companies opted for a paperless solution and used blockchain to trade nearly $100,000 worth of butter and cheese—clearly a time-sensitive transaction. By doing so, a process that previously took up to ten days was reduced to less than four hours—from issuing to approving the letter of credit.\n",

            "Automated and secure contract fulfillment. Smart contracts are sets of instructions coded into tokens issued on a blockchain that can self-execute under specific conditions. These can enable automated fulfillment of contracts. For example, one retailer wanted to streamline its supply-chain-management efforts, so it began recording all processes and actions, from vendor to customer, and coding them into smart contracts on a blockchain.

            "\n",
            "One reason for this is the emergence of competing technologies. In the payments space, for example, blockchain isn’t the only fintech disrupting the value chain—60 percent of the nearly $12 billion invested in US fintechs in 2021 was focused on payments and lending. Given how complicated blockchain solutions can be—and the fact that simple solutions are frequently the best—blockchain may not always be the answer to payment challenges.\n",

            "Interoperability across blockchain networks and outside systems.

            "Potential growth could be inhibited by a few factors: for one, several well-known applications have inherently limited scalability, including energy or infrastructure requirements. Further, uncertainty about regulatory or governance developments could keep consumers shy—for instance, if there is a lack of clarity on who will enforce smart contracts. The unresolved threat of cyberattacks also remains a fear for potential blockchain users. And finally, other tech trends—namely AI—have sucked up all the oxygen (and funding) in the room.\n",

Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.\\n\\nWhy is blockchain important?\\n\\nBusiness runs on information. The faster information is received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared, and observable information that is stored on an immutable ledger that only permissioned network members can access. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, and new efficiencies and opportunities.\\n\\nIBM Blockchain 101: Quick-start guide for developers\\n\\nBuild a kick-starter blockchain network and start coding with IBM's next-generation blockchain platform.\\n\\nRegister for the guide on sustainability trends\\n\\nKey elements of a blockchain\\n\\nDistributed ledger technology\\n\\nAll network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.\\n\\nNo participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.\\n\\nTo speed transactions, a set of rules that are called a smart contract is stored on the blockchain and run automatically. A smart contract defines conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.\\n\\nHow blockchain works\\n\\nAs each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data\\n\\nThose transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual). The data block can record the information of your choice: who, what, when, where, how much. It can even record the condition, such as the temperature of a food shipment.\\n\\nEach block is connected to the ones before and after it\\n\\nThese blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\\n\\nTransactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain\\n\\nEach additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain. Rendering the blockchain tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of immutability. Removing the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor, and builds a ledger of transactions you and other network members can trust.\\n\\nBenefits of blockchain\\n\\nWhat needs to change: Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping and third-party validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows business, drains the bottom line, and means that we need a better way. Enter blockchain.\\n\\nWith blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are receiving accurate and timely data. And that your confidential blockchain records are shared only with network members to whom you granted access.\\n\\nConsensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction.\\n\\nWith a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network, time-wasting record reconciliations are eliminated. And to speed transactions, a set of rules that are called a smart contract can be stored on the blockchain and run automatically.\\n\\nBlockchain 101 in five minutes\\n\\nStep inside the basics of blockchain technology: how blocks contain data representing anything of value, how they’re chronologically connected in an immutable chain, and the differences between blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\\n\\nLearn how the decentralized nature of blockchain sets it apart from traditional record-keeping, the value of a permissioned blockchain for business transactions, and how blockchain promotes new levels of trust and transparency.\\n\\nA traceable supply chain\\n\\nThe food industry is just one of many being transformed through blockchain technology. Learn how it can trace when, where and how food has been grown, picked, shipped and processed — all while protecting network-participant data.\\n\\nBlockchain builds trust\\n\\nBlockchain creates trust because it represents a shared record of the truth. Data that everyone can believe in will help power other new technologies that dramatically increase efficiency, transparency and confidence.\\n\\nTypes of blockchain networks\\n\\nThere are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned, or built by a consortium.\\n\\nPublic blockchain networks\\n\\nA public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include the substantial computational power that is required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. These are important considerations for enterprise use cases of blockchain.\\n\\nPrivate blockchain networks\\n\\nA private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, run a consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on premises.\\n\\nPermissioned blockchain networks\\n\\nBusinesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and in what transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.\\n\\nConsortium blockchains\\n\\nMultiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These preselected organizations determine who submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be permissioned and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.\\n\\nRisk management systems for blockchain networks\\n\\nWhen building an enterprise blockchain application, it’s important to have a comprehensive security strategy that uses cybersecurity frameworks, assurance services, and best practices to reduce risks against attacks and fraud.\\n\\nLearn more about blockchain security\\n\\nBlockchain use cases and applications\\n\\nTracing fresh seafood from the moment it’s caught\\n\\nIBM Food Trust is helping Raw Seafoods increase trust across the food supply chain by tracing every catch right from the water — all the way to supermarkets and restaurants.\\n\\nImproving cryptocurrency security in financial services\\n\\nINBLOCK issues Metacoin cryptocurrency, which is based on Hyperledger Fabric, to help make digital asset transactions faster, more convenient and safer.\\n\\nTransforming healthcare outcomes with blockchain\\n\\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform can change the way your ecosystem ensures trust, data provenance and efficiency to improve patient care and profitability.

            "Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n",
            "\n",
            "An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.\n",

            "\n",
            "Business runs on information. The faster information is received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared, and observable information that is stored on an immutable ledger that only permissioned network members can access. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, and new efficiencies and opportunities.\n",

            "\n",
            "All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.\n",
            "\n",
            "To speed transactions, a set of rules that are called a smart contract is stored on the blockchain and run automatically. A smart contract defines conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.\n",

            "How blockchain works\n",
            "\n",
            "As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data\n",
            "\n",
            "Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual). The data block can record the information of your choice: who, what, when, where, how much. It can even record the condition, such as the temperature of a food shipment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Each block is connected to the ones before and after it\n",
            "\n",
            "These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain\n",
            "\n",
            "Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain. Rendering the blockchain tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of immutability.

            "\n",
            "What needs to change: Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping and third-party validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows business, drains the bottom line, and means that we need a better way. Enter blockchain.\n",
            "\n",
            "With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are receiving accurate and timely data. And that your confidential blockchain records are shared only with network members to whom you granted access.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "With a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network, time-wasting record reconciliations are eliminated. And to speed transactions, a set of rules that are called a smart contract can be stored on the blockchain and run automatically.\n",

They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—the term used to describe the inability to be altered.\\n\\nBecause there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.\\n\\nSince Bitcoin\\'s introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\\n\\nBlockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.\\n\\nDifferent types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger.\\n\\nIn Bitcoin’s case, the blockchain is decentralized, so no single person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain control.\\n\\nDecentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Xiaojie Liu\\n\\nHow Does a Blockchain Work?\\n\\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\\n\\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\\n\\nThe Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a block (other blockchains use different size blocks). Once it is full, certain information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the block header hash.\\n\\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block\\'s header, creating a chain of blocks.\\n\\nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin\\'s blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.\\n\\nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.\\n\\nEvery node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\\n\\nThe nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases every attempt. Every miner starts with a nonce of zero. If the resulting hash isn\\'t equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.\\n\\nGenerating these hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about—it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.\\n\\nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).\\n\\nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin\\'s process.\\n\\nBlockchain Decentralization\\n\\nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would prevent it from happening because they compare block hashes. This way, no single node within the network can alter information within the chain.\\n\\nBecause of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the information and history (like the transactions in cryptocurrency) are irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it is also possible for a non-public blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company\\'s inventory. Most blockchains wouldn\\'t \"store\" these items; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token.\\n\\nBlockchain Transparency\\n\\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes. \\n\\nFor example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. While the hackers may have been anonymous—except for their wallet address—the crypto they extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are published on the blockchain.\\n\\nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.\\n\\nIs Blockchain Secure?\\n\\nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \"end\" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be changed.\\n\\nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block\\'s hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, this can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks.\\n\\nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\\n\\nA new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the computational power of the network (called a 51% attack). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally fast—the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of 566–657 exahashes per second (18 zeros) between May and June 2024.\\n\\nThe Ethereum blockchain is not likely to be hacked either—the attackers would need to control more than half of the blockchain\\'s staked ether. Between April and June 2024, more than 32 million ETH was staked by more than one million validators. An attacker or group would need to own more than half of the validators, about 16.4 million ETH, and be randomly selected to validate blocks enough times to get their blocks implemented.\\n\\nBitcoin vs. Blockchain\\n\\nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that blockchain had its first real-world application.\\n\\nThe Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”\\n\\nThe key thing to understand is that Bitcoin uses blockchain as a means to transparently record a ledger of payments or other transactions between parties.\\n\\nBlockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. This could be in the form of transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more.\\n\\nCurrently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections.\\n\\nThe nature of blockchain\\'s immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country\\'s citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token.\\n\\nEach candidate could then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate they wish to vote for. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots.\\n\\nBlockchain vs. Banks\\n\\nBlockchains have been heralded as a disruptive force in the finance sector, especially with the functions of payments and banking. However, banks and decentralized blockchains are vastly different.\\n\\nTo see how a bank differs from blockchain, let’s compare the banking system to Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation.\\n\\nHow Are Blockchains Used?\\n\\nAs we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, tens of thousands of other cryptocurrency systems are running on a blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions.\\n\\nSome companies experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, and Unilever, among others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.\\n\\nWhy do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria; in some cases, hazardous materials were accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating.\\n\\nUsing blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, to delivery. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner—potentially saving lives. This is one example of blockchain in practice, but many other forms of blockchain implementation exist.\\n\\nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than personal banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see that money hit your account.\\n\\nEven if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.\\n\\nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.\\n\\nThe settlement and clearing process for stock traders can take up to three days (or longer if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period. Blockchain could drastically reduce that time.\\n\\nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This design also allows for easier cross-border transactions because it bypasses currency restrictions, instabilities, or lack of infrastructure by using a distributed network that can reach anyone with an internet connection.\\n\\nHealthcare providers can leverage blockchain to store their patients’ medical records securely. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key so that they are only accessible to specific individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.\\n\\nIf you have ever spent time in your local Recorder’s Office, you will know that recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county’s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.\\n\\nThis process is not just costly and time-consuming, it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.\\n\\nProving property ownership can be nearly impossible in war-torn countries or areas with little to no government or financial infrastructure and no Recorder’s Office. If a group of people living in such an area can leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear timelines of property ownership could be established.\\n\\nA smart contract is computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate transactions. It operates under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the smart contract conducts the transaction for the users.\\n\\nAs in the IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as “Organic,” “Local,” and “Fair Trade.”\\n\\nAs reported by Forbes, the food industry is increasingly adopting the use of blockchain to track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, blockchain could facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia.\\n\\nUsing blockchain in this way would make votes nearly impossible to tamper with. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election.\\n\\nPros and Cons of Blockchain\\n\\nFor all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.\\n\\nImproved accuracy by removing human involvement in verification\\n\\nCost reductions by eliminating third-party verification\\n\\nDecentralization makes it harder to tamper with\\n\\nTransactions are secure, private, and efficient\\n\\nTransparent technology\\n\\nProvides a banking alternative and a way to secure personal information for citizens of countries with unstable or underdeveloped governments\\n\\nSignificant technology cost associated with some blockchains\\n\\nLow transactions per second\\n\\nHistory of use in illicit activities, such as on the dark web\\n\\nRegulation varies by jurisdiction and remains uncertain\\n\\nData storage limitations\\n\\nBenefits of Blockchains\\n\\nAccuracy of the Chain\\n\\nTransactions on the blockchain network are approved by thousands of computers and devices. This removes almost all people from the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain and not be accepted by the rest of the network.\\n\\nTypically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction or a notary to sign a document. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee when they accept credit card payments because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.\\n\\nBlockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change.\\n\\nBy spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with.\\n\\nEfficient Transactions\\n\\nTransactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week—but a blockchain works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.\\n\\nOn some blockchains, transactions can be completed in minutes and considered secure after just a few. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.\\n\\nPrivate Transactions\\n\\nMany blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access transaction details, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like Bitcoin are fully anonymous; they are actually pseudonymous because there is a viewable address that can be associated with a user if the information gets out.\\n\\nOnce a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. After the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its unique hash and the unique hash of the block before it. Therefore, the blocks cannot be altered once the network confirms them.\\n\\nMany blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. However, it also means there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.\\n\\nPrivate or permission blockchains may not allow for public transparency, depending on how they are designed or their purpose. These types of blockchains might be made only for an organization that wishes to track data accurately without allowing anyone outside of the permissioned users to see it.\\n\\nAlternatively, there might come a point where publicly traded companies are required to provide investors with financial transparency through a regulator-approved blockchain reporting system. Using blockchains in business accounting and financial reporting would prevent companies from altering their financials to appear more profitable than they really are.\\n\\nBanking the Unbanked\\n\\nPerhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and cryptocurrency is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, location, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.4 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth. Moreover, nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.\\n\\nThese people are often paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places, incentivizing robbers or violence. While not impossible to steal, crypto makes it more difficult for would-be thieves.\\n\\nDrawbacks of Blockchains\\n\\nAlthough blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the Bitcoin network\\'s proof-of-work system to validate transactions consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the energy consumed by the millions of devices on the Bitcoin network is more than Pakistan consumes annually.\\n\\nSome solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. For example, bitcoin-mining farms have been set up to use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or energy from wind farms.\\n\\nSpeed and Data Inefficiency\\n\\nBitcoin is a perfect case study for the possible inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin\\'s PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it\\'s estimated that the blockchain network can only manage about seven transactions per second (TPS). Although other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, perform better than Bitcoin, blockchain still limits them. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 65,000 TPS.\\n\\nSolutions to this issue have been in development for years. There are currently blockchain projects that claim tens of thousands of TPS. Ethereum is rolling out a series of upgrades that include data sampling, binary large objects (BLOBs), and rollups. These improvements are expected to increase network participation, reduce congestion, decrease fees, and increase transaction speeds.\\n\\nThe other issue with many blockchains is that each block can only hold so much data. The block size debate has been and continues to be one of the most pressing issues for the scalability of blockchains in the future.\\n\\nWhile confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, it also allows for illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably the Silk Road, an online dark web illegal-drug and money laundering marketplace operating from February 2011 until October 2013, when the FBI shut it down. \\n\\nThe dark web allows users to buy and sell illegal goods without being tracked by using the Tor Browser and make illicit purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is in stark contrast to U.S. regulations, which require financial service providers to obtain information about their customers when they open an account. They are supposed to verify the identity of each customer and confirm that they do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations.\\n\\nIllicit activity accounted for only 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2023.\\n\\nThis system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts, but allows criminals to transact more easily. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked world, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash.\\n\\nMany in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation of cryptocurrencies. Several jurisdictions are tightening control over certain types of crypto and other virtual currencies. However, no regulations have yet been introduced that focus on restricting blockchain uses and development, only certain products created using it.\\n\\nAnother significant implication of blockchains is that they require storage. This may not appear to be substantial because we already store lots of information and data. However, as time passes, the number of growing blockchain uses will require more storage, especially on blockchains where nodes store the entire chain.\\n\\nCurrently, data storage is centralized in large centers. But if the world transitions to blockchain for every industry and use, its exponentially growing size would mean more advanced techniques to reduce its size or that any participants would need to continually upgrade their storage.\\n\\nThis could become significantly expensive in terms of both money and physical space needed, as the Bitcoin blockchain itself was more than 581 gigabytes on June 29, 2024—and this blockchain records only bitcoin transactions. This is small compared to the amount of data stored in large data centers, but a growing number of blockchains will only add to the amount of storage already required for the connected and digital world.\\n\\nWhat Exactly Is a Blockchain?\\n\\nSimply put, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. Bits of data are stored in files known as blocks, and each network node has a replica of the entire database. Security is ensured since the majority of nodes will not accept a change if someone tries to edit or delete an entry in one copy of the ledger.\\n\\nWhat Is a Blockchain in Easy Terms?\\n\\nImagine you typed some information into a document on your computer and sent it through a program that gave you a string of numbers and letters (called hashing, with the string called a hash). You add this hash to the beginning of another document and type information into it. Again, you use the program to create a hash, which you add to the following document. Each hash is a representation of the previous document, which creates a chain of encoded documents that cannot be altered without changing the hash. Each document is stored on computers in a network. This network of programs compares each document with the ones they have stored and accepts them as valid based on the hashes they generate. If a document doesn\\'t generate a hash that is a match, that document is rejected by the network.\\n\\nWhat Is a Blockchain for Beginners?\\n\\nA blockchain is a distributed network of files chained together using programs that create hashes, or strings of numbers and letters that represent the information contained in the files. Every network participant is a computer or device that compares these hashes to the one they generate. If there is a match, the file is kept. If there isn\\'t, the file is rejected.\\n\\nWith many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer intermediaries.\\n\\nAs we head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology—it’s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. Tomorrow, we may see a combination of blockchains, tokens, and artificial intelligence all incorporated into business and consumer solutions.\\n\\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

            "You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. But the key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\n",
            "\n",
            "A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a block (other blockchains use different size blocks). Once it is full, certain information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the block header hash.\n",
            "\n",
            "The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Transactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain they are taking place on. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your cryptocurrency wallet—the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins.\n",
            "\n",
            "Every node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the \"nonce,\" short for number used once.\n",
            "\n",
            "The nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases every attempt. Every miner starts with a nonce of zero. If the resulting hash isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving the reward.\n",
            "\n",
            "Generating these hashes until a specific value is found is the \"proof-of-work\" you hear so much about—it \"proves\" the miner did the work. The amount of work it takes to validate the hash is why the Bitcoin network consumes so much computational power and energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once a block is closed, a transaction is complete. However, the block is not considered to be confirmed until five other blocks have been validated. Confirmation takes the network about one hour to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes).\n",
            "\n",
            "Not all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the Ethereum network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. This is much faster and less energy intensive than Bitcoin's process.\n",

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.\\n\\nAs explained by Wikipedia, “Blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto”—the pseudonym of an unknown person or persons—“in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin… [which] made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.”\\n\\nWhile blockchain is still largely confined to use in recording and storing transactions for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, proponents of blockchain technology are developing and testing other uses for blockchain, including these:\\n\\nBlockchain for payment processing and money transfers. Transactions processed over a blockchain could be settled within a matter of seconds and reduce (or eliminate) banking transfer fees.\\n\\nBlockchain for monitoring of supply chains. Using blockchain, businesses could pinpoint inefficiencies within their supply chains quickly, as well as locate items in real time and see how products perform from a quality-control perspective as they travel from manufacturers to retailers.\\n\\nBlockchain for digital IDs. Microsoft is experimenting with blockchain technology to help people control their digital identities, while also giving users control over who accesses that data.\\n\\nBlockchain for data sharing. Blockchain could act as an intermediary to securely store and move enterprise data among industries.\\n\\nBlockchain for copyright and royalties protection. Blockchain could be used to create a decentralized database that ensures artists maintain their music rights and provides transparent and real-time royalty distributions to musicians. Blockchain could also do the same for open source developers.\\n\\nBlockchain for Internet of Things network management. Blockchain could become a regulator of IoT networks to “identify devices connected to a wireless network, monitor the activity of those devices, and determine how trustworthy those devices are” and to “automatically assess the trustworthiness of new devices being added to the network, such as cars and smartphones.”\\n\\nBlockchain for healthcare. Blockchain could also play an important role in healthcare: “Healthcare payers and providers are using blockchain to manage clinical trials data and electronic medical records while maintaining regulatory compliance.”\\n\\nWhat are the business benefits of blockchain?\\n\\nThe primary benefit of blockchain is as a database for recording transactions, but its benefits extend far beyond those of a traditional database. Most notably, it removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor, as well as providing these business benefits:\\n\\nTime savings. Blockchain slashes transaction times from days to minutes. Transaction settlement is faster because it doesn’t require verification by a central authority.\\n\\nCost savings. Transactions need less oversight. Participants can exchange items of value directly. Blockchain eliminates duplication of effort because participants have access to a shared ledger.\\n\\nTighter security. Blockchain’s security features protect against tampering, fraud, and cybercrime.\\n\\nBlockchain explained\\n\\nAs described in Blockchain for Dummies, “Blockchain owes its name to the way it stores transaction data—in blocks linked together to form a chain. As the number of transactions grows, so does the blockchain. Blocks record and confirm the time and sequence of transactions, which are then logged into the blockchain, within a discrete network governed by rules agreed to by the network participants.\\n\\n“Each block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identifier), timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block. The previous block hash links the blocks together and prevents any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.” In theory, the method renders the blockchain tamperproof.\\n\\nThe four key concepts behind blockchain are:\\n\\nShared ledger. A shared ledger is an “append-only” distributed system of record shared across a business network. “With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.”\\n\\nPermissions. Permissions ensure that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable. “With the ability to constrain network participation, organizations can more easily comply with data protection regulations, such as those stipulated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)” and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\\n\\nSmart contracts. A smart contract is “an agreement or set of rules that govern a business transaction; it’s stored on the blockchain and is executed automatically as part of a transaction.”\\n\\nConsensus. Through consensus, all parties agree to the network-verified transaction. Blockchains have various consensus mechanisms, including proof of stake, multisignature, and PBFT (practical Byzantine fault tolerance).\\n\\nEach blockchain network has various participants who play these roles, among others:\\n\\nBlockchain users. Participants (typically business users) with permissions to join the blockchain network and conduct transactions with other network participants.\\n\\nRegulators. Blockchain users with special permissions to oversee the transactions happening within the network.\\n\\nBlockchain network operators. Individuals who have special permissions and authority to define, create, manage, and monitor the blockchain network.\\n\\nCertificate authorities. Individuals who issue and manage the different types of certificates required to run a permissioned blockchain.\\n\\nBlockchain and Hyperledger\\n\\nHyperledger is “an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation and supported by industry players like IBM, Intel and SAP to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.”\\n\\nHyperledger participants believe that “only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption.”\\n\\nThe objective of the Hyperledger project “is to advance cross-industry collaboration by developing blockchains and distributed ledgers, with a particular focus on improving the performance and reliability of these systems (as compared to comparable cryptocurrency designs) so that they are capable of supporting global business transactions by major technological, financial and supply chain companies.”\\n\\nBlockchain is frequently claimed to be an “unhackable” technology. But 51% attacks allow threat actors to “gain control over more than half of a blockchain’s compute power and corrupt the integrity of the shared ledger. … While this particular attack is expensive and difficult, the fact that it was effective means that security professionals should treat blockchain as a useful technology—not a magical answer to all problems.”\\n\\nThe 51% attack takes advantage of what is known as the 51% problem: “If a single party possesses 51% of a mining pool, it is possible to falsify an entry into the blockchain, allowing for double spending, and even to fork a new chain to the advantage of the mining pool.”\\n\\nThe two main types of blockchain, public and private, offer different levels of security. Public blockchains “use computers connected to the public internet to validate transactions and bundle them into blocks to add to the ledger. … Private blockchains, on the other hand, typically only permit known organizations to join.” Because any organization can join public blockchains, they might not be right for enterprises concerned about the confidentiality of the information moving through the network.\\n\\nAnother difference between public and private blockchains regards participant identity. Public blockchains “are typically designed around the principle of anonymity. … A private blockchain consists of a permissioned network in which consensus can be achieved through a process called ‘selective endorsement,’ where known users verify the transactions. The advantage of this for businesses is that only participants with the appropriate access and permissions can maintain the transaction ledger. There are still a few issues with this method, including threats from insiders, but many of them can be solved with a highly secure infrastructure.”\\n\\nBlockchain technologies are growing at an unprecedented rate and powering new concepts for everything from shared storage to social networks. From a security perspective, we are breaking new ground. As developers create blockchain applications, they should give precedent to securing their blockchain applications and services. Activities such as performing risk assessments, creating threat models, and doing code analysis, such as static code analysis, interactive application security testing, and software composition analysis, should all be on a developer’s blockchain application roadmap. Building security in from the start is critical to ensuring a successful and secure blockchain application.\\n\\nRelated SBOM content\\n\\nSee how to build an SBOM in minutes\\n\\nAre you building an accurate, compliant SBOM?\\n\\nGet the recipe for an actionable SBOM\\n\\nA Guide to CISA’s Six Types of SBOMs\\n\\nDetermine which SBOM is right for you Download the guide\\n\\nEasily generate an accurate SBOM\\n\\nQuestions about application security?', 'timestamp': '2024-08-11T08:21:00', 'title': 'What Is Blockchain and How Does It Work? | Synopsys', 'url': 'https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-blockchain.html'}\n",

            "Shared ledger. A shared ledger is an “append-only” distributed system of record shared across a business network. “With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Permissions. Permissions ensure that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable. “With the ability to constrain network participation, organizations can more easily comply with data protection regulations, such as those stipulated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)” and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n",
            "\n",
            "Smart contracts. A smart contract is “an agreement or set of rules that govern a business transaction; it’s stored on the blockchain and is executed automatically as part of a transaction.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Consensus. Through consensus, all parties agree to the network-verified transaction. Blockchains have various consensus mechanisms, including proof of stake, multisignature, and PBFT (practical Byzantine fault tolerance).\n",
            "\n",
            "Each blockchain network has various participants who play these roles, among others:\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockchain users. Participants (typically business users) with permissions to join the blockchain network and conduct transactions with other network participants.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regulators. Blockchain users with special permissions to oversee the transactions happening within the network.\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockchain network operators. Individuals who have special permissions and authority to define, create, manage, and monitor the blockchain network.\n",
            "\n",
            "Certificate authorities. Individuals who issue and manage the different types of certificates required to run a permissioned blockchain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockchain and Hyperledger\n",
            "\n",
            "Hyperledger is “an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation and supported by industry players like IBM, Intel and SAP to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Hyperledger participants believe that “only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The objective of the Hyperledger project “is to advance cross-industry collaboration by developing blockchains and distributed ledgers, with a particular focus on improving the performance and reliability of these systems (as compared to comparable cryptocurrency designs) so that they are capable of supporting global business transactions by major technological, financial and supply chain companies.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockchain is frequently claimed to be an “unhackable” technology. But 51% attacks allow threat actors to “gain control over more than half of a blockchain’s compute power and corrupt the integrity of the shared ledger. … While this particular attack is expensive and difficult, the fact that it was effective means that security professionals should treat blockchain as a useful technology—not a magical answer to all problems.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The 51% attack takes advantage of what is known as the 51% problem: “If a single party possesses 51% of a mining pool, it is possible to falsify an entry into the blockchain, allowing for double spending, and even to fork a new chain to the advantage of the mining pool.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The two main types of blockchain, public and private, offer different levels of security. Public blockchains “use computers connected to the public internet to validate transactions and bundle them into blocks to add to the ledger. … Private blockchains, on the other hand, typically only permit known organizations to join.” Because any organization can join public blockchains, they might not be right for enterprises concerned about the confidentiality of the information moving through the network.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another difference between public and private blockchains regards participant identity. Public blockchains “are typically designed around the principle of anonymity. … A private blockchain consists of a permissioned network in which consensus can be achieved through a process called ‘selective endorsement,’ where known users verify the transactions. The advantage of this for businesses is that only participants with the appropriate access and permissions can maintain the transaction ledger. There are still a few issues with this method, including threats from insiders, but many of them can be solved with a highly secure infrastructure.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Blockchain technologies are growing at an unprecedented rate and powering new concepts for everything from shared storage to social networks. From a security perspective, we are breaking new ground. As developers create blockchain applications, they should give precedent to securing their blockchain applications and services. Activities such as performing risk assessments, creating threat models, and doing code analysis, such as static code analysis, interactive application security testing, and software composition analysis, should all be on a developer’s blockchain application roadmap. Building security in from the start is critical to ensuring a successful and secure blockchain application.\n",

Why is blockchain important? How do different industries use blockchain? What are the features of blockchain technology? What are the key components of blockchain technology? How does blockchain work? What are the types of blockchain networks? What are blockchain protocols? How did blockchain technology evolve? What are the benefits of blockchain technology? What is the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain? What is the difference between a database and a blockchain? How is blockchain different from the cloud? What is Blockchain as a Service? What are AWS Blockchain services?\\n\\nWhat is blockchain technology?\\n\\nBlockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain. The data is chronologically consistent because you cannot delete or modify the chain without consensus from the network. As a result, you can use blockchain technology to create an unalterable or immutable ledger for tracking orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions. The system has built-in mechanisms that prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency in the shared view of these transactions.\\n\\nWhy is blockchain important?\\n\\nTraditional database technologies present several challenges for recording financial transactions. For instance, consider the sale of a property. Once the money is exchanged, ownership of the property is transferred to the buyer. Individually, both the buyer and the seller can record the monetary transactions, but neither source can be trusted. The seller can easily claim they have not received the money even though they have, and the buyer can equally argue that they have paid the money even if they haven’t.\\n\\nTo avoid potential legal issues, a trusted third party has to supervise and validate transactions. The presence of this central authority not only complicates the transaction but also creates a single point of vulnerability. If the central database was compromised, both parties could suffer.\\n\\nBlockchain mitigates such issues by creating a decentralized, tamper-proof system to record transactions. In the property transaction scenario, blockchain creates one ledger each for the buyer and the seller. All transactions must be approved by both parties and are automatically updated in both of their ledgers in real time. Any corruption in historical transactions will corrupt the entire ledger. These properties of blockchain technology have led to its use in various sectors, including the creation of digital currency like Bitcoin.\\n\\nHow do different industries use blockchain?\\n\\nBlockchain is an emerging technology that is being adopted in innovative manner by various industries. We describe some use cases in different industries in the following subsections:\\n\\nEnergy companies use blockchain technology to create peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and streamline access to renewable energy. For example, consider these uses:\\n\\nBlockchain-based energy companies have created a trading platform for the sale of electricity between individuals. Homeowners with solar panels use this platform to sell their excess solar energy to neighbors. The process is largely automated: smart meters create transactions, and blockchain records them.\\n\\nWith blockchain-based crowd funding initiatives, users can sponsor and own solar panels in communities that lack energy access. Sponsors might also receive rent for these communities once the solar panels are constructed.\\n\\nTraditional financial systems, like banks and stock exchanges, use blockchain services to manage online payments, accounts, and market trading. For example, Singapore Exchange Limited, an investment holding company that provides financial trading services throughout Asia, uses blockchain technology to build a more efficient interbank payment account. By adopting blockchain, they solved several challenges, including batch processing and manual reconciliation of several thousand financial transactions.\\n\\nMedia and entertainment\\n\\nCompanies in media and entertainment use blockchain systems to manage copyright data. Copyright verification is critical for the fair compensation of artists. It takes multiple transactions to record the sale or transfer of copyright content. Sony Music Entertainment Japan uses blockchain services to make digital rights management more efficient. They have successfully used blockchain strategy to improve productivity and reduce costs in copyright processing.\\n\\nRetail companies use blockchain to track the movement of goods between suppliers and buyers. For example, Amazon retail has filed a patent for a distributed ledger technology system that will use blockchain technology to verify that all goods sold on the platform are authentic. Amazon sellers can map their global supply chains by allowing participants such as manufacturers, couriers, distributors, end users, and secondary users to add events to the ledger after registering with a certificate authority. \\n\\nWhat are the features of blockchain technology?\\n\\nBlockchain technology has the following main features:\\n\\nDecentralization in blockchain refers to transferring control and decision making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group) to a distributed network. Decentralized blockchain networks use transparency to reduce the need for trust among participants. These networks also deter participants from exerting authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.\\n\\nImmutability means something cannot be changed or altered. No participant can tamper with a transaction once someone has recorded it to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, you must add a new transaction to reverse the mistake, and both transactions are visible to the network.\\n\\nA blockchain system establishes rules about participant consent for recording transactions. You can record new transactions only when the majority of participants in the network give their consent.\\n\\nWhat are the key components of blockchain technology?\\n\\nBlockchain architecture has the following main components:\\n\\nA distributed ledger\\n\\nA distributed ledger is the shared database in the blockchain network that stores the transactions, such as a shared file that everyone in the team can edit. In most shared text editors, anyone with editing rights can delete the entire file. However, distributed ledger technologies have strict rules about who can edit and how to edit. You cannot delete entries once they have been recorded.\\n\\nCompanies use smart contracts to self-manage business contracts without the need for an assisting third party. They are programs stored on the blockchain system that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. They run if-then checks so that transactions can be completed confidently. For example, a logistics company can have a smart contract that automatically makes payment once goods have arrived at the port.\\n\\nPublic key cryptography\\n\\nPublic key cryptography is a security feature to uniquely identify participants in the blockchain network. This mechanism generates two sets of keys for network members. One key is a public key that is common to everyone in the network. The other is a private key that is unique to every member. The private and public keys work together to unlock the data in the ledger. \\n\\nFor example, John and Jill are two members of the network. John records a transaction that is encrypted with his private key. Jill can decrypt it with her public key. This way, Jill is confident that John made the transaction. Jill's public key wouldn't have worked if John's private key had been tampered with.\\n\\nHow does blockchain work?\\n\\nWhile underlying blockchain mechanisms are complex, we give a brief overview in the following steps. Blockchain software can automate most of these steps:\\n\\nStep 1 – Record the transaction\\n\\nA blockchain transaction shows the movement of physical or digital assets from one party to another in the blockchain network. It is recorded as a data block and can include details like these:\\n\\nWho was involved in the transaction?\\n\\nWhat happened during the transaction?\\n\\nWhen did the transaction occur?\\n\\nWhere did the transaction occur?\\n\\nWhy did the transaction occur?\\n\\nHow much of the asset was exchanged?\\n\\nHow many pre-conditions were met during the transaction?\\n\\nStep 2 – Gain consensus\\n\\nMost participants on the distributed blockchain network must agree that the recorded transaction is valid. Depending on the type of network, rules of agreement can vary but are typically established at the start of the network.\\n\\nStep 3 – Link the blocks\\n\\nOnce the participants have reached a consensus, transactions on the blockchain are written into blocks equivalent to the pages of a ledger book. Along with the transactions, a cryptographic hash is also appended to the new block. The hash acts as a chain that links the blocks together. If the contents of the block are intentionally or unintentionally modified, the hash value changes, providing a way to detect data tampering. \\n\\nThus, the blocks and chains link securely, and you cannot edit them. Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and therefore the entire blockchain. This is like stacking wooden blocks to make a tower. You can only stack blocks on top, and if you remove a block from the middle of the tower, the whole tower breaks.\\n\\nStep 4 – Share the ledger\\n\\nThe system distributes the latest copy of the central ledger to all participants.\\n\\nWhat are the types of blockchain networks?\\n\\nThere are four main types of decentralized or distributed networks in the blockchain:\\n\\nPublic blockchain networks\\n\\nPublic blockchains are permissionless and allow everyone to join them. All members of the blockchain have equal rights to read, edit, and validate the blockchain. People primarily use public blockchains to exchange and mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. \\n\\nPrivate blockchain networks\\n\\nA single organization controls private blockchains, also called managed blockchains. The authority determines who can be a member and what rights they have in the network. Private blockchains are only partially decentralized because they have access restrictions. Ripple, a digital currency exchange network for businesses, is an example of a private blockchain.\\n\\nHybrid blockchain networks\\n\\nHybrid blockchains combine elements from both private and public networks. Companies can set up private, permission-based systems alongside a public system. In this way, they control access to specific data stored in the blockchain while keeping the rest of the data public. They use smart contracts to allow public members to check if private transactions have been completed. For example, hybrid blockchains can grant public access to digital currency while keeping bank-owned currency private.\\n\\nConsortium blockchain networks\\n\\nA group of organizations governs consortium blockchain networks. Preselected organizations share the responsibility of maintaining the blockchain and determining data access rights. Industries in which many organizations have common goals and benefit from shared responsibility often prefer consortium blockchain networks. For example, the Global Shipping Business Network Consortium is a not-for-profit blockchain consortium that aims to digitize the shipping industry and increase collaboration between maritime industry operators.\\n\\nWhat are blockchain protocols?\\n\\nThe term blockchain protocol refers to different types of blockchain platforms that are available for application development. Each blockchain protocol adapts the basic blockchain principles to suit specific industries or applications. Some examples of blockchain protocols are provided in the following subsections:\\n\\nHyperledger Fabric is an open-source project with a suite of tools and libraries. Enterprises can use it to build private blockchain applications quickly and effectively. It is a modular, general-purpose framework that offers unique identity management and access control features. These features make it suitable for various applications, such as track-and-trace of supply chains, trade finance, loyalty and rewards, and clearing settlement of financial assets.\\n\\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain platform that people can use to build public blockchain applications. Ethereum Enterprise is designed for business use cases.\\n\\nCorda is an open-source blockchain project designed for business. With Corda, you can build interoperable blockchain networks that transact in strict privacy. Businesses can use Corda's smart contract technology to transact directly, with value. Most of its users are financial institutions.\\n\\nQuorum is an open-source blockchain protocol that is derived from Ethereum. It is specially designed for use in a private blockchain network, where only a single member owns all the nodes, or in a consortium blockchain network, where multiple members each own a portion of the network.\\n\\nHow did blockchain technology evolve?\\n\\nBlockchain technology has its roots in the late 1970s when a computer scientist named Ralph Merkle patented Hash trees or Merkle trees. These trees are a computer science structure for storing data by linking blocks using cryptography. In the late 1990s, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta used Merkle trees to implement a system in which document timestamps could not be tampered with. This was the first instance in the history of blockchain.\\n\\nThe technology has continued to evolve over these three generations:\\n\\nFirst generation – Bitcoin and other virtual currencies\\n\\nIn 2008, an anonymous individual or group of individuals known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto outlined blockchain technology in its modern form. Satoshi's idea of the Bitcoin blockchain used 1 MB blocks of information for Bitcoin transactions. Many of the features of Bitcoin blockchain systems remain central to blockchain technology even today.\\n\\nSecond generation – smart contracts\\n\\nA few years after first-generation currencies emerged, developers began to consider blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrency. For instance, the inventors of Ethereum decided to use blockchain technology in asset transfer transactions. Their significant contribution was the smart contracts feature.\\n\\nThird generation – the future\\n\\nAs companies discover and implement new applications, blockchain technology continues to evolve and grow. Companies are solving limitations of scale and computation, and potential opportunities are limitless in the ongoing blockchain revolution.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of blockchain technology?\\n\\nBlockchain technology brings many benefits to asset transaction management. We list a few of them in the following subsections:\\n\\nBlockchain systems provide the high level of security and trust that modern digital transactions require. There is always a fear that someone will manipulate underlying software to generate fake money for themselves. But blockchain uses the three principles of cryptography, decentralization, and consensus to create a highly secure underlying software system that is nearly impossible to tamper with. There is no single point of failure, and a single user cannot change the transaction records.\\n\\nBusiness-to-business transactions can take a lot of time and create operational bottlenecks, especially when compliance and third-party regulatory bodies are involved. Transparency and smart contracts in blockchain make such business transactions faster and more efficient.\\n\\nEnterprises must be able to securely generate, exchange, archive, and reconstruct e-transactions in an auditable manner. Blockchain records are chronologically immutable, which means that all records are always ordered by time. This data transparency makes audit processing much faster.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain?\\n\\nBitcoin and blockchain might be used interchangeably, but they are two different things. Since Bitcoin was an early application of blockchain technology, people inadvertently began using Bitcoin to mean blockchain, creating this misnomer. But blockchain technology has many applications outside of Bitcoin.\\n\\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates without any centralized control. Bitcoins were originally created to make financial transactions online but are now considered digital assets that can be converted to any other global currency, like USD or euros. A public Bitcoin blockchain network creates and manages the central ledger. \\n\\nA public ledger records all Bitcoin transactions, and servers around the world hold copies of this ledger. The servers are like banks. Although each bank knows only about the money its customers exchange, Bitcoin servers are aware of every single Bitcoin transaction in the world.\\n\\nAnyone with a spare computer can set up one of these servers, known as a node. This is like opening your own Bitcoin bank instead of a bank account.\\n\\nOn the public Bitcoin network, members mine for cryptocurrency by solving cryptographic equations to create new blocks. The system broadcasts each new transaction publicly to the network and shares it from node to node. Every ten minutes or so, miners collect these transactions into a new block and add them permanently to the blockchain, which acts like the definitive account book of Bitcoin.\\n\\nMining requires significant computational resources and takes a long time due to the complexity of the software process. In exchange, miners earn a small amount of cryptocurrency. The miners act as modern clerks who record transactions and collect transaction fees.\\n\\nAll participants across the network reach a consensus on who owns which coins, using blockchain cryptography technology.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between a database and a blockchain?\\n\\nBlockchain is a special type of database management system that has more features than a regular database. We describe some significant differences between a traditional database and a blockchain in the following list:\\n\\nBlockchains decentralize control without damaging trust in the existing data. This is not possible in other database systems.\\n\\nCompanies involved in a transaction cannot share their entire database. But in blockchain networks, each company has its copy of the ledger, and the system automatically maintains consistency between the two ledgers.\\n\\nAlthough in most database systems you can edit or delete data, in blockchain you can only insert data.\\n\\nHow is blockchain different from the cloud?\\n\\nThe term cloud refers to computing services that can be accessed online. You can access Software as a Service (SaaS), Product as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) from the cloud. Cloud providers manage their hardware and infrastructure and give you access to these computing resources over the internet. They provide many more resources than just database management.If you want to join a public blockchain network, you need to provide your hardware resources to store your ledger copy. You could use a server from the cloud for this purpose too. Some cloud providers also offer complete Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) from the cloud.\\n\\nWhat is Blockchain as a Service?\\n\\nBlockchain as a Service (BaaS) is a managed blockchain service that a third party provides in the cloud. You can develop blockchain applications and digital services while the cloud provider supplies the infrastructure and blockchain building tools. All you have to do is customize existing blockchain technology, which makes blockchain adoption faster and more efficient. \\n\\nWhat are AWS Blockchain services?\\n\\nAWS Blockchain services provide purpose-built tools to support your requirement. You can use them to build everything from a centralized ledger database that maintains an immutable record of transactions to a multi-party, fully managed blockchain network that helps eliminate intermediaries. AWS has numerous validated blockchain solutions from partners who support all major blockchain protocols, including Hyperledger, Corda, Ethereum, Quorum, and more. As a result, you can develop blockchain and ledger applications more easily, quickly, and efficiently with AWS. Some useful AWS Blockchain services are as follows:\\n\\nAmazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log. It has a built-in journal that stores an accurate and sequenced entry of every data change. The journal is append-only, meaning that users can add data to the journal but cannot overwrite or delete it. \\n\\nAmazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that makes it easy to join public networks or create and manage scalable private networks using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

            "Decentralization in blockchain refers to transferring control and decision making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group) to a distributed network. Decentralized blockchain networks use transparency to reduce the need for trust among participants. These networks also deter participants from exerting authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.\n",
            "\n",
            "Immutability means something cannot be changed or altered. No participant can tamper with a transaction once someone has recorded it to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, you must add a new transaction to reverse the mistake, and both transactions are visible to the network.\n",
            "\n",
            "A blockchain system establishes rules about participant consent for recording transactions. You can record new transactions only when the majority of participants in the network give their consent.\n",

            "\n",
            "A distributed ledger is the shared database in the blockchain network that stores the transactions, such as a shared file that everyone in the team can edit. In most shared text editors, anyone with editing rights can delete the entire file. However, distributed ledger technologies have strict rules about who can edit and how to edit. You cannot delete entries once they have been recorded.\n",
            "\n",
            "Companies use smart contracts to self-manage business contracts without the need for an assisting third party. They are programs stored on the blockchain system that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. They run if-then checks so that transactions can be completed confidently. For example, a logistics company can have a smart contract that automatically makes payment once goods have arrived at the port.\n",
            "\n",
            "Public key cryptography\n",
            "\n",
            "Public key cryptography is a security feature to uniquely identify participants in the blockchain network. This mechanism generates two sets of keys for network members. One key is a public key that is common to everyone in the network. The other is a private key that is unique to every member. The private and public keys work together to unlock the data in the ledger. \n",
            "\n",
            "For example, John and Jill are two members of the network. John records a transaction that is encrypted with his private key. Jill can decrypt it with her public key.

            "\n",
            "Step 1 – Record the transaction\n",
            "\n",
            "A blockchain transaction shows the movement of physical or digital assets from one party to another in the blockchain network. It is recorded as a data block and can include details like these:\n",

            "How many pre-conditions were met during the transaction?\n",
            "\n",
            "Step 2 – Gain consensus\n",
            "\n",
            "Most participants on the distributed blockchain network must agree that the recorded transaction is valid. Depending on the type of network, rules of agreement can vary but are typically established at the start of the network.\n",
            "\n",
            "Step 3 – Link the blocks\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the participants have reached a consensus, transactions on the blockchain are written into blocks equivalent to the pages of a ledger book. Along with the transactions, a cryptographic hash is also appended to the new block. The hash acts as a chain that links the blocks together. If the contents of the block are intentionally or unintentionally modified, the hash value changes, providing a way to detect data tampering. \n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, the blocks and chains link securely, and you cannot edit them. Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and therefore the entire blockchain. This is like stacking wooden blocks to make a tower. You can only stack blocks on top, and if you remove a block from the middle of the tower, the whole tower breaks.\n",
            "\n",

            "Private blockchain networks\n",
            "\n",
            "A single organization controls private blockchains, also called managed blockchains. The authority determines who can be a member and what rights they have in the network. Private blockchains are only partially decentralized because they have access restrictions. Ripple, a digital currency exchange network for businesses, is an example of a private blockchain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hybrid blockchain networks\n",
            "\n",
            "Hybrid blockchains combine elements from both private and public networks. Companies can set up private, permission-based systems alongside a public system. In this way, they control access to specific data stored in the blockchain while keeping the rest of the data public. They use smart contracts to allow public members to check if private transactions have been completed. For example, hybrid blockchains can grant public access to digital currency while keeping bank-owned currency private.\n",

            "\n",
            "A group of organizations governs consortium blockchain networks. Preselected organizations share the responsibility of maintaining the blockchain and determining data access rights. Industries in which many organizations have common goals and benefit from shared responsibility often prefer consortium blockchain networks. For example, the Global Shipping Business Network Consortium is a not-for-profit blockchain consortium that aims to digitize the shipping industry and increase collaboration between maritime industry operators.\n",

            "\n",
            "Blockchain technology has its roots in the late 1970s when a computer scientist named Ralph Merkle patented Hash trees or Merkle trees. These trees are a computer science structure for storing data by linking blocks using cryptography. In the late 1990s, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta used Merkle trees to implement a system in which document timestamps could not be tampered with. This was the first instance in the history of blockchain.\n",

            "In 2008, an anonymous individual or group of individuals known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto outlined blockchain technology in its modern form. Satoshi's idea of the Bitcoin blockchain used 1 MB blocks of information for Bitcoin transactions. Many of the features of Bitcoin blockchain systems remain central to blockchain technology even today.\n",

            "\n",
            "A few years after first-generation currencies emerged, developers began to consider blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrency. For instance, the inventors of Ethereum decided to use blockchain technology in asset transfer transactions. Their significant contribution was the smart contracts feature.\n",

            "\n",
            "Blockchain systems provide the high level of security and trust that modern digital transactions require. There is always a fear that someone will manipulate underlying software to generate fake money for themselves. But blockchain uses the three principles of cryptography, decentralization, and consensus to create a highly secure underlying software system that is nearly impossible to tamper with. There is no single point of failure, and a single user cannot change the transaction records.\n",
            "\n",
            "Business-to-business transactions can take a lot of time and create operational bottlenecks, especially when compliance and third-party regulatory bodies are involved. Transparency and smart contracts in blockchain make such business transactions faster and more efficient.\n",
            "\n",
            "Enterprises must be able to securely generate, exchange, archive, and reconstruct e-transactions in an auditable manner. Blockchain records are chronologically immutable, which means that all records are always ordered by time. This data transparency makes audit processing much faster.\n",

            "\n",
            "Bitcoin and blockchain might be used interchangeably, but they are two different things. Since Bitcoin was an early application of blockchain technology, people inadvertently began using Bitcoin to mean blockchain, creating this misnomer. But blockchain technology has many applications outside of Bitcoin.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates without any centralized control. Bitcoins were originally created to make financial transactions online but are now considered digital assets that can be converted to any other global currency, like USD or euros. A public Bitcoin blockchain network creates and manages the central ledger. \n",
            "\n",
            "A public ledger records all Bitcoin transactions, and servers around the world hold copies of this ledger. The servers are like banks. Although each bank knows only about the money its customers exchange, Bitcoin servers are aware of every single Bitcoin transaction in the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyone with a spare computer can set up one of these servers, known as a node. This is like opening your own Bitcoin bank instead of a bank account.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the public Bitcoin network, members mine for cryptocurrency by solving cryptographic equations to create new blocks. The system broadcasts each new transaction publicly to the network and shares it from node to node. Every ten minutes or so, miners collect these transactions into a new block and add them permanently to the blockchain, which acts like the definitive account book of Bitcoin.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mining requires significant computational resources and takes a long time due to the complexity of the software process. In exchange, miners earn a small amount of cryptocurrency. The miners act as modern clerks who record transactions and collect transaction fees.\n",

You can access Software as a Service (SaaS), Product as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) from the cloud. Cloud providers manage their hardware and infrastructure and give you access to these computing resources over the internet. They provide many more resources than just database management.If you want to join a public blockchain network, you need to provide your hardware resources to store your ledger copy.

The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a reGrement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destrucGon of the ﬁne Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetraGon were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an eﬀort was made by the French and BriGsh Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it. However, the German erupGon swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of diﬀerent kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut oﬀ all communicaGons between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communicaGons for food and ammuniGon, which ran ﬁrst to Amiens and aSerwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparaGvely slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberGes and comforts which they have never known in their own. I have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and Calais were the scenes of desperate ﬁghGng. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Riﬂe Brigade, the 60th Riﬂes, and the Queen Victoria's Riﬂes, with a ba\\\\alion of BriGsh tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The BriGsh Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the oﬀer, and four days of intense street ﬁghGng passed before silence reigned over Calais, which marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought oﬀ by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacriﬁce, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the BriGsh ExpediGonary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of the light divisions, and the Gme gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be ﬂooded and to be held by the French troops. \"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/churchill_speech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their communicaGons to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, BriGsh and French Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by heavy a\\\\acks and far outnumbered in the air. When, a week ago today, I asked the House to ﬁx this aSernoon as the occasion for a statement, I feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be reembarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the BriGsh ExpediGonary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open ﬁeld or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammuniGon. These were the hard and heavy Gdings for which I called upon the House and the naGon to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the BriGsh Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the great BriGsh Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the ﬁeld or to be led into an ignominious and starving capGvity. That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved ﬁnal was yet to fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from exGncGon in the late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and BriGsh Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, eﬃcient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our leS ﬂank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior consultaGon, with the least possible noGce, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotenGary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole ﬂank and means of retreat. I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this piGful episode. The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the BriGsh at the shortest noGce to cover a ﬂank to the sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut oﬀ, and all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the ﬁnest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this ﬂank, as anyone who followed the operaGons on the map will see, contact was lost between the BriGsh and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were sGll farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast. The enemy a\\\\acked on all sides with great strength and ﬁerceness, and their main power, the power '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/churchill_speech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the ba\\\\le or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to ﬁre with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sowed magneGc mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hosGle aircraS, someGmes more than a hundred strong in one formaGon, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traﬃc which now began. For four or ﬁve days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was leS of them-together with great masses of infantry and arGllery, hurled themselves in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracGng appendix within which the BriGsh and French Armies fought. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve to embark the BriGsh and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They had to operate upon the diﬃcult coast, oSen in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an increasing concentraGon of arGllery ﬁre. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in condiGons such as these that our men carried on, with li\\\\le or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip aSer trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure of their devoGon and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought oﬀ many thousands of BriGsh and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and women on board them never faltered in their duty. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the ba\\\\le, so far as its range would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan ﬁghter strength, and struck at the German bombers and at the ﬁghters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was protracted and ﬁerce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable ﬁdelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreaGng BriGsh and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inﬂicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and BriGsh, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their naGve land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the a\\\\ributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuaGons. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protecGve a\\\\ack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it. This was a great trial of strength between the BriGsh and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a greater objecGve for the Germans in the air than to make evacuaGon from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have been an objecGve of greater military '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/churchill_speech.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='importance and signiﬁcance for the whole purpose of the war than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inﬂicted. Very large formaGons of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on several occasions from the a\\\\ack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in diﬀerent direcGons. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a BriGsh aeroplane, which had no more ammuniGon. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spiiire and the new Deﬁant-and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face. When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas a\\\\ack, I must say that I ﬁnd in these facts a sure basis upon which pracGcal and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the Gme being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilizaGon itself will be defended by the skill and devoGon of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their naGve land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and sha\\\\ering power, of whom it may be said that Every morn brought forth a noble chance And every chance brought forth a noble knight, deserve our graGtude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready, and conGnue ready to give life and all for their naGve land. I return to the Army. In the long series of very ﬁerce ba\\\\les, now on this front, now on that, ﬁghGng on three fronts at once, ba\\\\les fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger number of the enemy, and fought ﬁercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so wellin these ba\\\\les our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suﬀered bereavement or who are sGll anxious. The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed, and many in the House have felt the pangs of aﬄicGon in the sharpest form. But I will say this about the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this ﬁght it is inevitable that many have been leS in posiGons where honor required no further resistance from them. Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inﬂicted upon the enemy. But our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the opening days of the ba\\\\le of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns -- nearly one thousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not been proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the BriGsh ExpediGonary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some arGcles of equipment which were desirable, they were a very well and ﬁnely equipped Army. They had the ﬁrst-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exerGons which we make in this Island. An eﬀort the like of which has never been seen in '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/churchill_speech.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night and day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and customs and put them into the common stock. Already the ﬂow of muniGons has leaped forward. There is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has come upon us, without retarding the development of our general program. Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have passed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army has been lost, a large part of those forGﬁed lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone, many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy\\'s possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the BriGsh Isles. This has oSen been thought of before. When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his ﬂat-bo\\\\omed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone. \"There are bi\\\\er weeds in England.\" There are certainly a great many more of them since the BriGsh ExpediGonary Force returned. The whole quesGon of home defense against invasion is, of course, powerfully aﬀected by the fact that we have for the Gme being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have ever had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not conGnue. We shall not be content with a defensive war. We have our duty to our Ally. We have to reconsGtute and build up the BriGsh ExpediGonary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort. All this is in train; but in the interval we must put our defenses in this Island into such a high state of organizaGon that the fewest possible numbers will be required to give eﬀecGve security and that the largest possible potenGal of oﬀensive eﬀort may be realized. On this we are now engaged. It will be very convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day by the enemy; and the Government would beneﬁt by views freely expressed in all parts of the House by Members with their knowledge of so many diﬀerent parts of the country. I understand that some request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty\\'s Government. We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens and suspicious characters of other naGonaliGes, but also against BriGsh subjects who may become a danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom. I know there are a great many people aﬀected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present Gme and under the present stress, draw all the disGncGons which we should like to do. If parachute landings were a\\\\empted and ﬁerce ﬁghGng a\\\\endant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far be\\\\er out of the way, for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down FiSh Column acGviGes with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the '), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/churchill_speech.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content=\"supervision and correcGon of the House, without the slightest hesitaGon unGl we are saGsﬁed, and more than saGsﬁed, that this malignancy in our midst has been eﬀecGvely stamped out. Turning once again, and this Gme more generally, to the quesGon of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, sGll less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading ﬂeet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginaGons of many ConGnental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same Gme, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised. I have, myself, full conﬁdence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the naGon. The BriGsh Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their naGve soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not ﬂag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall ﬁght in France, we shall ﬁght on the seas and oceans, we shall ﬁght with growing conﬁdence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall ﬁght on the beaches, we shall ﬁght on the landing grounds, we shall ﬁght in the ﬁelds and in the streets, we shall ﬁght in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the BriGsh Fleet, would carry on the struggle, unGl, in God's good Gme, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberaGon of the old. \")]\n",

So in doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.\\n\\nThe enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power\\n\\nof their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk\\n\\nand the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy\\n\\nbegan to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart.\\n\\nThey sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft,\\n\\nsometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the evernarrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and women on board them never faltered in their duty.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it. This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face. When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that\\n\\nEvery morn brought forth a noble chance And every chance brought forth a noble knight,\\n\\ndeserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are\\n\\nready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.\\n\\nI return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so wellin these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious. The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed, and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this about the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in positions where honor required no further resistance from them. Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the enemy. But our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns -- nearly one thousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not been proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment which were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of which has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night and day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and customs and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward.\\n\\nThere is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has\\n\\ncome upon us, without retarding the development of our general program.\\n\\nNevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have\\n\\npassed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France\\n\\nand Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army\\n\\nhas been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone, many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy\\'s possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone. \"There are bitter weeds in England.\" There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned.\\n\\nThe whole question of home defense against invasion is, of course, powerfully affected by the fact that we have for the time being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have ever had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not continue. We shall not be content with a defensive war. We have our duty to our Ally. We have to reconstitute and build up the British Expeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort. All this is in train; but in the interval we must put our defenses in this Island into such a high state of organization that the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security and that the largest possible potential of offensive effort may be realized. On this we are now engaged. It will be very convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day by the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House by Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country. I understand that some request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty\\'s Government. We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens and suspicious characters of other nationalities, but also against British subjects who may become a danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom. I know there are a great many people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress, draw all the distinctions which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted and fierce fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way, for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out.\\n\\nTurning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that\\n\\nthere has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute\\n\\nguarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised. I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty\\'s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God\\'s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.')]\n",
            "[Document(metadata={'source': '/content/churchill_speech.txt'}, page_content='Winston Churchill Speech - We Shall Fight on the Beaches\\nWe Shall Fight on the Beaches\\nJune 4, 1940\\nHouse of Commons\\nFrom the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the\\nsecond week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and\\nFrench Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was\\nnot immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and\\nthe Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have\\ninvolved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the\\nabandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German\\npenetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed\\ncommand in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in\\nBelgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly\\ncreated French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\\nHowever, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different\\nkinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off\\nall communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for\\nfood and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its\\nway up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and\\nmechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there\\nplodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people,\\nalways so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\\nhave never known in their own.\\nI have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and\\nCalais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\\nthen withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen\\nVictoria\\'s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand\\nstrong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned\\nthe offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which\\nmarked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the\\nNavy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At\\nleast two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British\\nExpeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories\\nof the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be\\nheld by the French troops.\\nThus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice\\nremained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost\\nsurrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were\\npressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.\\nWhen, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I\\nfeared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I\\nthought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be reembarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the\\nBritish Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field\\nor else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\\ntidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole\\nroot and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to\\nbuild, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or\\nto be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\\nThat was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to\\nfall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and\\nhis Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the\\nlate war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and\\nBritish Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at\\nthe last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid,\\nand even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong,\\nguarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\\nconsultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own\\npersonal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed\\nour whole flank and means of retreat.\\nI asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not\\nfeel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.\\nThe surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the\\nsea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared\\nthe fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed.

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His\\nMajesty\\'s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British\\nEmpire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the\\ndeath their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even\\nthough large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of\\nthe Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the\\nend, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing\\nconfidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we\\nshall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the\\nstreets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment\\nbelieve, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the\\nseas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God\\'s good time,\\nthe New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.')]\n"
